  @ Features of Angular
    $ DOM [Document Object Model]
      * It treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure in which each node is an object representing a part of the document
        # Document
          $ Root Element (<html>)
            = Element (<head>)
                ^ Element (<title>)
                  ? Text ("My Title")
            = Element (<body>)
                ^ Element (<a>)
                  * Attribute ("href")
                  ? Text ("My Link")
                ^ Element (<h1>)
                  ? Text ("My Header")

      * Angular uses regular DOM, this will update the entire tree structure of HTML tags until it reaches the data to be updated

      & Consider about 100s of updates on the same HTML page and the HTML block is replaced for each request

    # TypeScript
      * It's a superset of Javascipt and offers excellent consistency

      * Can be installed as an NPM package

    ? Data-Binding
      * Allows an internet user to manipulate Web page elements using a web browser

      * Web page contains interactive components

      $ Two way data-binding

    ^ Testing
      # Jasmine to run various tests

      ? Jasmine framework allows various functionalities to write different kinda test cases

      $ Karma is the task-runner for the tests
